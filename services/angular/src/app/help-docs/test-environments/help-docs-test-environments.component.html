    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>This page describes the Test Environments section in the Resource Pooling Tool.</p>
    <p>It describes what the purpose of this feature is and how it works.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="purpose"></a>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The purpose of having a test environments section in RPT is so that there can be a clear view of all test environments and
        their state.</p>
    <p>It provides the user of RPT a UI which clearly displays information about each environment.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="test-environment-table"></a>
    <h3>Test Environments Table</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The test environments table is where the test environments and the information related to each environment is displayed.
    </p>
    <p>The table is updated with the test environment live status from pipelines.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Available:</b>
            <p>The test environment is free and ready to use.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Reserved:</b>
            <p>The test environment is currently being used, typically its running through a pipeline.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Quarantine:</b>
            <p>The test environment is in a quarantine state. For a test environment to be in Quarantine state means
            something is wrong with the test environment or something is failing. Typically, a test environment
            will be placed in a Quarantine state as a result of a failed pipeline.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Standby:</b>
            <p>A test environment in Standby will not be picked up to be used by CI/CD pipelines.
            It will however be refreshed daily by a refresh pipeline triggered by RPT to keep it up to date.
            If the sticky environment gets quarantined, the freshest Standby environment will become available.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Refreshing:</b>
            <p>A test environment in the "Refreshing" state is currently being refreshed and should not be interrupted.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each test environment can be part of a pool. The name of the assigned pool is also displayed in the table</p>
    <br>

            <td>Comments</td>
            <td>This is a textarea which will allow a user to input other information they may want to

    <h3>Change Status</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>You may want to move a test environment to Available status to show it is ready to be used.</p>
    <p>You may also realize there is a problem and you want to manually set it into Quarantine.</p>
    <p>Lastly, you may want to use the test environment in a pipeline and therefore you must change the status to Reserved.</p>
    <p>To do these actions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the three buttons under Actions in the test environment table</li>
        <li>Hover over "Environment Actions"</li>

    <hr>
    <p>You may want to re-order the test environments as they appear in the table.</p>
    <p>A table row is draggable if the move cursor appears as you hover over the environment in the table.</p>
    <p>To re-order the elements, simply drag and drop the selected test environment to the desired position in the table.</p>
    <p>Please note that the ordering of the elements in the table has no impact on behavior of the system.</p>
