    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>This page describes the Pools section in the Resource Pooling Tool.</p>
    <p>It describes what the purpose of this feature is and how it works.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="purpose"></a>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The purpose of having a Pools section in RPT is to provide a view of all test environments in a particular pool and
        their state.</p>
    <p>It provides the user of RPT a UI which clearly displays information about each environment associated with a pool.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="pools"></a>
    <h3>Pools</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The Pools table displays a subset of test environments belonging to a selected pool along with the information related to the environment.</p>
    <p>To view the test environments in a pool select a 'pool' from the dropdown 'Pools' menu in the navigation bar. The page can be bookmarked for the desired pool.</p>
    <p>The table is updated with the test environment live status from pipelines.</p>
    <p>For more information about on the test environment table check out <a routerLink="/help-docs/test-environments">'Test Environments'</a> section under <a routerLink="/help-docs">'Help Docs'</a>.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="reorder-elements"></a>
    <h3>Re-order Elements</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>You may want to re-order the test environments as they appear in the table.</p>
    <p>A table row is draggable if the move cursor appears as you hover over the environment in the table.</p>
    <p>To re-order the elements, simply drag and drop the selected test environment to the desired position in the table.</p>
    <p>Please note that the ordering of the elements in the table has no impact on behavior of the system.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="copy-environment-names"></a>
    <h3>Copy Environment Names</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>You may want to copy the name of a test environment to your clipboard.</p>
    <p>This can be done in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Right clicking the name of the test environment and selecting 'Copy'.</p></li>
      <li><p>Opening the environment properties view and double-clicking the name of the test environment before selecting 'Copy'.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <a class="anchor" name="copy-additional-info"></a>
    <h3>Copy Additional Info</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>You may want to copy the contents of 'Additional Info' to your clipboard.</p>
    <p>Please note that this can only be done while the 'Additional Info' is in edit mode.</p>
    <p>You can enter edit mode by clicking the pen located to the right, and exit edit mode by clicking the tick.</p>
